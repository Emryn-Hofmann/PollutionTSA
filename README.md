# PollutionTSA
Time Series Analysis of California Pollution Data

Dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/sogun3/uspollution \
Formed part of the assessed component of the MATH334: Time Series Analysis module, you can find the `R` code, Project Report and Project Presentation (made using Beamer) files attached.\
We focussed our analysis on two of the four pollutants, namely O<sub>3</sub>(Ozone) and NO<sub>2</sub> (Nitrogen Dioxide) and on two individual sites within California, which happened to both be within Los Angeles. One was near the airport LAX, and the other within the city, near one of the highways.\
Packages utilised include the `tidyverse`, `corrplot`, `imputeTS` packages.\
Other contributors to the project are Rachel Harwood, Alex Reid and Aleksejs Nazarovs.

I received a grade of 94% for my contribution towards the project.
